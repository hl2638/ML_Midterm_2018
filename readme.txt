Already accomplished
5000 games of 8.19 patch

TODO:
filter out <15min matches
feature extraction: champions, time, gold diff, Btowers, Rtowers, ...


Thoughts
first step: no champion, real time winning rate
champion clustering
champion combination/interaction??(HOW???)
===>winning rate over time curve before game starts 
(equivalent to)=team strength compared at each moment

Schedule:
Week1
10000 matches: ID list, match list
filter out <15min games, then get timeline of matches

Week2
preprocess data: get features, timeline stats
train logistic/train stats

Week3
cluster champions
add champion features

Week4
TBD
